# Open Source Utilities

A collection of small, practical Python projects designed to solve everyday problems. Each utility in this repository represents a real-world solution that I've developed to address specific challenges in my daily life.

## Philosophy

This repository follows the principle of building tools that solve actual problems. Rather than theoretical exercises, each project here has been created out of necessity and has proven useful in real-world scenarios.

## Projects
